0,When you unzip bag it opens “fully” so I thought I’d be able to use both pockets but when you go to zip up full bag whatever is in pocket on the left “falls” into pocket on the right. I was disappointed in this.,unzip bag opens fully thought would able use pockets go zip full bag whatever pocket left falls pocket right disappointed

0,"Love using this bag for makeup stuff! It’s small in size, but because of the shape, it can hold lots of small items. Apart from using as a makeup bag, I can definitely see it being used for carrying chargers or small electronics, breastfeeding pump accessories, or even stationary equipment. Highly recommended product and I love using it daily. Would have given a 5, but the zipper is *sometimes* a pain to close, but the advantages of the bag make up for it.",love using bag makeup stuff small size shape hold lots small items apart using makeup bag definitely see used carrying chargers small electronics breastfeeding pump accessories even stationary equipment highly recommended product love using daily would given zipper sometimes pain close advantages bag make
0,"I use this bag to hold my makeup brush collection, which has recently outgrown my brush roll. The quality is decent, but somewhat underwhelming for the price. The color of the zipper is more yellow-gold than I would have liked (which honestly makes it look a bit tacky) and takes some work to open and close. I would have liked if the zipper was higher-quality.The organization is okay enough with the different pockets, but the zippered pocket is not fixed at the bottom - there's a gap that my brushes can get under, which sucks because I was hoping to use that as a divider to keep my face brushes and eye brushes separated.The size is nice - big enough to hold my large collection of brushes, but not as bulky as my makeup bags or the bag I was previously using to hold brushes. It even fits my hard case of blending sponges! I love how this bag opens out flat - very handy for digging one-handed through my brushes, no more worrying about keeping the bag upright so brushes don't roll all over the place.There is a deep crease in the product due to it being packaged folded down SUPER flat, but I'm hoping that it will come out with time and use.",use bag hold makeup brush collection recently outgrown brush roll quality decent somewhat underwhelming price color zipper yellow gold would liked honestly makes look bit tackyconfusion takes work open close would liked zipper higher quality organization okay enough different pockets zippered pocket fixed bottom gap brushes get sucks hoping use divider keep face brushes eye brushes separated size nice big enough hold large collection brushes bulky makeup bags bag previously using hold brushes even fits hard case blending sponges love bag opens flat handy digging one handed brushes worrying keeping bag upright brushes roll place deep crease product due packaged folded super flat hoping come time use
0,"This bag comes folded flat, but it’ll be loaded with products so I know it’ll get its shape. I love the gold accents and the quality overall feels very nice. The gold makes it feel more expensive. The bag will be easy to clean if something ever spills on the i side or outside, the interior is like a waterproof material and outside is faux leather.The biggest surprise was that the front panel is textured, personally I didn’t love that, I wish it was all smooth leather like the rest of the bag.Trying to capture it in my last picture.This is my second bag in this style, and honestly it’s a game changer. It’s so nice being able to see more items when the bag is fully open vs other makeup bags where you have to rifle around more to find smaller items. It’s also nice to have a zipper portion inside to store delicate/valuable/smaller items for quick access.Overall I am very happy with this, but I’m taking away one star for texture.",bag comes folded flat loaded products know get shape love gold accents quality overall feels nice gold makes feel expensive bag easy clean something ever spills side outside interior like waterproof material outside faux leather biggest surprise front panel textured personally love wish smooth leather like rest bag trying capture last picture second bag style honestly game changer nice able see items bag fully open vs makeup bags rifle around find smaller items also nice zipper portion inside store delicate valuable smaller items quick access overall happy taking away one star texture
0,"I was in the market for a new makeup bag. I needed something big enough to fit all of my stuff, and this fit the bill. The bag is significant but not overly big. I like how it opens so I can easily see my stuff and don’t have to dig through to find what I want. The material seems nice enough. It has a very aesthetic look, easy to clean, and the handle is a nice touch. I do notice that on my bag, the zipper on this sometimes gets stuck.",market new makeup bag needed something big enough fit stuff fit bill bag significant overly big like opens easily see stuff dig find want material seems nice enough aesthetic look easy clean handle nice touch notice bag zipper sometimes gets stuck
0,"This is a bit like the Tardis - much bigger on the inside. However, I like my bottles to stand up when traveling and they do not have the ability to in this case. I can fit all my make up, travel bottles and medication in this without a problem and it doesn’t take up as much room as my other travel toiletry bags. The material has an odd feel to it but I think it helps with cleaning it.",bit like cards much bigger inside however like bottles stand traveling ability case fit make travel bottles medication without problem take much room travel toiletry bags material odd feel think helps cleaning
0,"Hello everyone,This travel makeup bag definitely surprised me with qualities I’m sure others would also appreciate. The color scheme is elegant, the faux smooth leather on top with contrasting texture on the bottom makes it look high end, well made, It’s waterproof, has a handle and most importantly although not big, you can fit quite a lot in it. I used it during a recent trip and was able to fit all the makeup, skin care and even hair ties I needed. While closed, it seems small, but once opened, it expands, has convenient “wall pockets”, two big compartments and a middle zipper. All my products were visible which facilitated me getting ready everydaysince I didn’t have to look through tons of products. My rating reflects the fact that it gets stained very easily and now post travel, I can’t remove the stains both in and out which makes it look worn and dirty.Thank you!",hello everyone travel makeup bag definitely surprised qualities sure others would also appreciate color scheme elegant faux smooth leather top contrasting texture bottom makes look high end well made waterproof handle importantly although big fit quite lot used recent trip able fit makeup skin care even hair ties needed closed seems small opened expands convenient wall pockets two big compartments middle zipper products visible facilitated getting ready everydaysince look tons products rating reflects fact gets stained easily post travel remove stains makes look worn dirty thank
1,"so i like to do my nails in front of the tv at night so i can hang out with my bf and i wanted a case i can carry everything in instead of making multiple trips back and forth bringing everything out to the living room, i was worried this would be too small to fit everything but it actually fit so much that i’m using it to store all my lash extension supplies too!! the divider in the middle makes it so convenient to divide between the two. i’m amazed this not only carries my nail polish and tools but even my nail polish remover bottle!! the way it folds up however keeps it from getting too bulky it is so so clever. it opens up to fold flat and give you so much space but then when zipped shut it’s somehow half the size. it fits perfectly under my vanity shelf so i can quickly grab everything i need. plus the design is so so cute and i love the gold hardware!!! so minimal but classy and feminine. unbeatable and it feels durable and tough. buy it now!!!! great for travel also!",like nails front night hang wanted case carry everything instead making multiple trips back forth bringing everything living room worried would small fit everything actually fit much using store lash extension supplies divider middle makes convenient divide two amazed carries nail polish tools even nail polish remover bottle way folds however keeps getting bulky clever opens fold flat give much space zipped shut somehow half size fits perfectly vanity shelf quickly grab everything need plus design cute love gold hardware minimal classy feminine unbeatable feels durable tough buy great travel also

With that stated, when I found this Large Capacity Traveling Cosmetic Bag, I was educated on what people are gravitating to, through my daughters eek's and screams of joy when I gave her this case.She said that she had just recently seen one of these on one her social media educational videos that was discussing how to travel efficiently. She grabbed it, and immediately ran to her room to try to put her travel necessities together in it, in preparation for a weekender excursion with a group of her friends.She seemed to easily pack in all of the items she would need for her trip rather quickly, and came back out to the living room to display her efficiently packed essentials. With great amazement, I looked on as she told me just how the bag was supposed to be used to separate her bath and beauty itemsin a neat foldout containment bag.Well she went on her trip, and returned to boast of how her friends were so amazed to see and appreciate all of the hoopla surrounding these nifty personal hygiene foldout sacks, that hold every essential item you'll need for that well deserved get away.She said as I had already known, that these bags are well worth every penny spent on them, simply for the consolidated convenience of having everything you'll need neatly tucked in place in a singular awesomely crafted beauty bag.",seems popularity across multiple age groups youth guided suggestions infamous youtubers tie towers carry multitudes listening youth well subscribed social media venues however kids say young adults stated found large capacity traveling cosmetic bag educated people gravitating daughters eek screams joy gave case said recently seen one one social media educational videos discussing travel efficiently grabbed immediately ran room try put travel necessities together preparation weekender excursion group friends seemed easily pack items would need trip rather quickly came back living room display efficiently packed essentials great amazement looked told bag supposed used separate bath beauty items neat foldout containment bag well went trip returned boast friends amazed see appreciate hoopla surrounding nifty personal hygiene foldout sacks hold every essential item need well deserved get away said already known bags well worth every penny spent simply consolidated convenience everything need neatly tucked place singular awesomely crafted beauty bag

1,This is a very nice looking makeup bag. I love the color and the mixed materials it is made of. Part of it feels like canvas and the other part the PU leather. The zipper works great and does not catch. The inside liner is very nice as well. The flaps on the end are long enough to keep your makeup from falling out. There is a zipper pouch in the middle that can separate the bag as well as hold other products.,nice looking makeup bag love color mixed materials made part feels like canvas part leather zipper works great catch inside liner nice well flaps end long enough keep makeup falling zipper pouch middle separate bag well hold products
1,The design of this bag was so well done. I love that this bag makes it easy to separate me and my husband's basic toiletries. I like that since the zipper is on the corner the bag lays in a way that easily displays the inside of the bag. I also like that it has side pockets to further organize each side. I like that it's still small and won't take up massive space in our luggage. One thing I did think was funny is that one side of the bag doesn't match the material on the rest of the bag. Now that I see this it does show in the preview pictures for the product. This doesn't matter to me but it might to some.,design bag well done love bag makes easy separate husband basic toiletries like since zipper corner bag lays way easily displays inside bag also like side pockets organize side like still small take massive space luggage one thing think funny one side bag match material rest bag see show preview pictures product matter might

1,"Contrasting color zipper adds to nice appearance yet is easy/normal to use. When it opens bag sits flat so you can get anything in and out easily. Center divider is actually a zipper pocket, which is nice for extra things especially small things. Nice internal side pockets with elastic to get into the sides easier, I like this feature. Strong outer material, very well made, strong stitching to hold up for a long time. Really like this because other make-up bags are a little smaller and my long make-up sticks never fit. This one is great!",contrasting color zipper adds nice appearance yet easy normal use opens bag sits flat get anything easily center divider actually zipper pocket nice extra things especially small things nice internal side pockets elastic get sides easier like feature strong outer material well made strong stitching hold long time really like make bags little smaller long make sticks never fit one great
